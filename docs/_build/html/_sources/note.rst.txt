    This software was developed by enthusiastic scientists duct-taping code together to make our lives easier. We didn’t account for all the weird ways things could break—so if you’ve found a bug, head over to our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/Julian-Hochhaus/LG4X-V2>`_ and open an `issue <https://github.com/Julian-Hochhaus/LG4X-V2/issues>`_. We'll do our best to fix it!

    The software and docs are a work in progress. If something’s unclear, open a discussion or issue on our `GitHub page <https://github.com/Julian-Hochhaus/LG4X-V2>`_ —your feedback helps us improve!
