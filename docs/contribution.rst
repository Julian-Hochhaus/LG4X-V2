Bugs
----
Oh no, you found a bug in LG4X-V2? Not surprising—after all, we’re not professional programmers, just some enthusiastic scientists duct-taping code together to make our lives easier. We probably didn’t think of all the weird ways things could break (oops).

Head over to our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/Julian-Hochhaus/LG4X-V2>`_. and open an `issue <https://github.com/Julian-Hochhaus/LG4X-V2/issues>`_ —tell us what went wrong, and we’ll do our best to fix it while pretending we totally knew what we were doing all along!
